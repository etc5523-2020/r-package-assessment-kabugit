covtrack was designed to provide a quick overview of COVID 19 cases and deaths in four major countries - USA, India, Brazil and Australia. An app is embedded inside this package that contains separate tabs for analysis and a "User guide" section that will help you understand how to execute visualisations.

An app such as this can be used by any entity that needs a proper understanding of the pandemic in the above mentioned countries. Not only can this help with getting a general overview of the COVID 19 story so far, but also influence decision making for future endeavours.
